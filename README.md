A Custom Omeka theme for Hispanic Liverpool Community Collection Project, prepared by Hafiz Hanif.

_This folder contains a complete Omeka installation. If you want to take a look at the custom theme, please head to **omekahispanicliverpool** folder in the theme directory._

This is a custom Omeka theme, developed based on Omeka's own Berlin theme. The concept of the theme derived from the main project website (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/modernlanguages/research/hispanic/hispanicliverpool), including the colour scheme and the header image. The project is set to collect images and stories from the Hispanic community.

## Project Description
The Hispanic Liverpool Project works with families, individuals, archives and heritage organisations to gather and preserve the forgotten stories of Liverpool's Hispanic community from the nineteenth century until the present. By bringing together sources from census returns and trade directories to family photographs and memories, we hope to put Liverpool's Hispanic history back on the local and global map.

## Todo
* Templating web pages
* Moving to live server
* Link everything to database

## Design Influences
I've designed this theme based on one of the listed websites in the AWWWARDS website. Colour scheme is based on the existing project website hosted under University of Warwick's website (link above). Only 1 font is used i.e. Roboto, with some variations of font-weight an font-size, to differentiate between headings and body copy. This helps the site to look simple, clean, and consistent throughout the site. 

## Lesson Learned
### From design perspective
* To keep tab on what ever websites I've used as a reference when designing, so that it can be properly referenced in this document, for future use.
* Absolute positioning should be avoided, in case there's an 'admin-bar' conflict.

### From development perspective
*  To begin to use bootstrap v3 in future projects so that the code will be more manageable.
*To have a proper steps of setting up projects in local development environment.
